# Charging Station Management System (CSMS) Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the Charging Station Management System (CSMS), akin to systems like the ChargePoint backend system. The CSMS is designed to manage charging stations, charging processes, and customer interactions for electric vehicle drivers (eDrivers).

## System Architecture

CSMS is composed of the following services:

- **Transaction Service**: Manages communications between charging stations and authentication services.
- **Authentication Service**: Validates user charging permissions.

### Technologies & Features

- **Programming Language & Framework**: Kotlin with Spring Boot for responsive microservices.
- **Messaging**: Kafka is used as an asynchronous queuing mechanism to ensure reliable inter-service communication.
- **Data Validation**: Robust validation mechanism for incoming request bodies.
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker-Compose for simplified deployment and scalability.

## Transaction Service
This service is a REST API that has a responsibility to handle communication between clients (charging stations) and `Authentication Service`.
### Authorization Request

**Endpoint**: `POST /transaction/authorize`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "stationUuid": "<uuid of station>",
  "driverIdentifier": {"id": "<identifier-string>"}
}
```

**Response Body**:

```json
{
  "authorizationStatus": "Accepted|Invalid|Unknown|Rejected"
}
```

| Identifier Status                                | Authorization Status |
|--------------------------------------------------|:--------------------:|
| Identifier is known and the card is allowed to charge |       Accepted       |
| Identifier is not known                           |       Unknown        |
| Identifier is not valid                           |       Invalid        |
| Identifier is known but card is not allowed for charging |       Rejected       |

## Authentication Service
The service is responsible for listening to a specific topic(`AuthenticationRequests`). When a new event arrives, it checks whether the customer is allowed to charge. Finally, it produces another topic(`AuthenticationResponses`)'s event to express the customer authorization status.

## Kafka's Topics
- **Topic**: AuthenticationRequests

    **Payload**:
    ```json
    {
      "requestId": "<uuid of request>",
      "userIdentifierId": "<identifier-string>"
    }
    ```
- **Topic**: AuthenticationResponses

  **Payload**:
  ```json
  {
    "requestId": "<uuid of request>",
    "authorizationStatus": "Accepted|Invalid|Unknown|Rejected"
  }
  ```
## How to start
You should have installed [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) only. To run the applications, please execute the following command at the root of the repository:
```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```
After this, the `Transaction Service` endpoint is accessible from the [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) URL.

## Future Improvements

- **Apache Avro Integration**: As CSMS expands to support multi-stack services, integrating Apache Avro for data serialization will enhance our system's ability to handle complex, distributed data structures efficiently and reliably. Avro's schema-based data serialization brings strong typing and compatibility checks that are essential for long-term maintenance and scalability of distributed systems.
- **Schema Registry Implementation**: To complement our use of Apache Avro, we plan to implement a Schema Registry. This will allow us to manage version control and maintain compatibility across the different schemas used in our services. A schema registry will also facilitate seamless schema evolution, preventing downtime and ensuring that all components within our distributed system communicate effectively without data mismatch.
- **Database Integration**: To enhance data management and scalability, we plan to transition from using mocked data to implementing a robust database system. This upgrade will support dynamic data storage, real-time access, and improved data integrity. By integrating a database, we can also enable more complex and customizable user interactions, thereby increasing the systemâ€™s overall efficiency and reliability.
